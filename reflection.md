Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?

    I did not consult any classmates.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?

    I attended Jordan's office hours on Wednesday 10/5

- What are your initial impressions of Java?

    I enjoy java but don't know any different since its the only programming language I've ever used!

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 

    The logic between java and python is essentially the same especially when using OOP.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    I got stuck on my code being "perfect" and would get frustrated when I came across an issue I wanted to fix but didn't have time for. I was able to make progress when I stopped letting perfectionism be a roadblock to completing assignments! My advice to someone taking this course in the future would be to pick your battles! If your code works as outlined in the rubric, don't beat yourself up trying to make it perfect. There's simply no time!
